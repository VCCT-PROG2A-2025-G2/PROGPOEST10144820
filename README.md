- **Quiz Window**: Interactive quiz interface with scoring system
- **Activity Log Window**: Display interface for user activity history

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Framework**: .NET Framework with Windows Forms
- **Language**: C# 
- **GUI**: Windows Forms (WinForms)
- **Architecture**: Model-based design with centralized window management

### Key Features Implementation
- **String Manipulation**: Used for basic NLP keyword detection
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Responsive GUI with proper event handling
- **Data Persistence**: In-memory storage for tasks, logs, and quiz data
- **Modular Design**: Separate models for different functionalities

## 🎮 How to Use

### Starting the Application
1. Launch the application from the main executable
2. The main chatbot window will open with all features accessible

### Adding Tasks
```
User: "Add task - Review privacy settings"
Bot: "Task added with description 'Review account privacy settings to ensure your data is protected.' Would you like a reminder?"
User: "Yes, remind me in 3 days"
Bot: "Got it! I'll remind you in 3 days."
```

### Taking the Quiz
- Access the cybersecurity quiz from the main menu
- Answer questions about phishing, passwords, and security best practices
- Receive immediate feedback and final score

### Viewing Activity Log
```
User: "Show activity log" or "What have you done for me?"
Bot displays recent actions:
1. Task added: 'Enable two-factor authentication' (Reminder set for 5 days)
2. Quiz started - 8/10 questions answered correctly
3. Reminder set: 'Review privacy settings' on [date]
```

### NLP Commands
The bot understands various phrasings:
- "Add a task to enable 2FA" 
- "Remind me to update my password tomorrow"
- "Set up a reminder for checking my privacy settings"

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
- Visual Studio 2019/2022 (for development)

### Running the Application
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio
3. Build the solution (Build → Build Solution)
4. Run the application (F5 or Debug → Start Debugging)
